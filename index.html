        She taught the world lessons about love. Her charity and sense of
        humanity towards those who were suffering made her truly exemplify the

        children.

        "I want to thank you for something, Mother Teresa. Your great work and
        your life have inspired so many Americans to become personally involved,
        themselves, in helping the poor. So many men and women in every area of
        life, in government and the private sector, have been led by the light
        of your love, and they have given greatly of themselves. And we thank
        you for your radiant example."
